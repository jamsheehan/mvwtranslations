And of course more time allowing for more directed attacks on others... <br><br>Turns are given out every 30 minutes, and are saved within your realm as action turns, usable any time.  Income, turns, and population growth are all automatic and based on your realm qualities. <br><br>There is much to learn, but starting is easy. <br><br> First things first, you should change your user name. To do this, click into Account Management from the bottom of the page and here you will see user name changes. Change the name to whatever you wish. <br><br> If you do not figure things out on your own, be sure to complete the Tutorial, check the forums, Message Boards, the Player Guide link at the bottom, and you will find other players are also helpful if you ask nicely... <br><br>You now have a small population.  So -- you will want to spend your initial income at least in part in growing your population, and be sure never to forget to upgrade your population production fairly often.<br><br>Each turn that passes (in real-time) brings you population and income from your population. <br><br>Do not underestimate the power of personal agreements with others, other groups, or alliances.  A strong backing from a community can go far to ensuring your safety, or military victories!
